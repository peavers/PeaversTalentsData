## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTICE - PROVIDER SUPPORT CHANGE

**As of this update, PeaversTalentsData now exclusively supports Archon as the data provider.** Support for Wowhead, Icy Veins, and U.GG has been discontinued to focus development efforts and ensure the highest quality data from our primary source.

**Community Contributions Welcome**: If you would like to see support restored for other providers (Wowhead, Icy Veins, U.GG), we encourage you to open a pull request! The foundation is there, and community contributions are always appreciated.
